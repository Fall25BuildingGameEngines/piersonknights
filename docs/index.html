    There are many possible points of improvement on the current design. An increased timespan of 8 more weeks would allow us to implement many things that we did not have the time to complete. There are a few key areas we would have liked to focus on within our game engine. 

The first would be creating a more robust and in-depth UI system that would allow us to better display information, such as text and the objects that the players can collect to use as distractions. We would also have liked to work more on building a better AI system for NPCs that would provide flexibility in creating more interesting behaviors. 

Another major thing would have been to focus more on level design, especially in ways that encourage collaboration between players. We would have loved to create more levels that give more difficulty and challenge for the players and really test their collaboration. Related to this, we would have liked to have expanded beyond local multiplayer into having options for online multiplayer to allow for more than two players and options to play as guards as well.
