  There are many possible points of improvement on the current design. An increased timespan of 8 more weeks would allow us to implement many things that we did not have the time to complete. There are a few key areas we would have liked to focus on within our game engine. There were many organizational and structural changes that would have been nicer and more convenient to build from, but we unfortunately did not have the time to make such large scale changes. For example, our scene management system could have used some structural changes. 

A major thing for us would be creating a more robust and in-depth UI system that would allow us to better display information, such as text and the objects that the players can collect to use as distractions. We initially wanted to have a counter images that displayed the number of objects the players have picked up and who they belong to. We would also have liked to work more on building a better AI system for NPCs that would provide flexibility in creating more interesting behaviors. It would have been nice to create a more generalized AI system that could be used to create guards with different and more complex behaviors. 

Another major thing would have been to focus more on level design, especially in ways that encourage collaboration between players. We would have loved to create more levels that give more difficulty and challenge for the players and really test their collaboration. Related to this, we would have liked to have expanded beyond local multiplayer into having options for online multiplayer to allow for more than two players and options to play as guards as well.
